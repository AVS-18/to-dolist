# to-dolist
Implementing a basic to-do-list in html, css, javascript. For such a simple project, separte css , javascript files werent required so used only one html file.
Basic functionalities included like togglehide() and rendertasks(). I have kept design simple as havent explored much of CSS and have just started out with Web Dev last monday.
