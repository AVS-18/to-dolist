# to-dolist
Implementing a basic to-do-list in html, css, javascript. For such a simple project, separte css , javascript files werent required so used only one html file.
Basic functionalities included like togglehide() ,addtasks() rendertasks() etc. Have kept design simple as havent explored much of CSS and have just started out with Web Dev last monday.
